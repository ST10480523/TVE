    <h3>&#127911; Nigguh 1 - Homeboy_Uche &#127911;</h3>
    <p>Real name Uchenna Osuigwe, If there was a heartbeat in our sound, it was his. From producing to rapping to designing the whole vibe.. He laid foundation. Rest in beats, KING. We don't move without him, even when he's not physically here.</p>

    <h3>&#127911; Nigguh 2 - ApesThePlug &#127911;</h3>
    <p>The Nkabi of the mic. Formely known as April 444. Known for his flows and that 'don't test me' presence. He said : "Won't catch me slipping, ingane ibukile.' That's not just a bar, that's a warning. He don't rap. He arrives.</p>

    <h3>&#127911; Nigguh 3 - 5am &#127911;</h3>
    <p>The Factor. Sharp with the pen, colder with the visuals. He's the kind to design your poster, rap over it, and then smoke you in a cypher. 5AM don't sleep. His bars move in shadows and shape the whole silhouette of the Ville</p>
